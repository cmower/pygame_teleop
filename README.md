# pygame_teleop

Tools for simple teleoperation examples/demos/experiments in
PyGame. Many times I have required a simple environment to test or
visualize an idea. Simple circles/rectangles/lines tend to be
sufficient before exending to a real robot or more advanced
simulation. I found myself very often re-writing the same code in
various scripts. This repo collects some of that code.
